It is intended for developers and technical team members who are involved in designing, building, and maintaining the application.
The conventions cover naming conventions for variables, functions, and files, as well as coding style guidelines and best practices for documentation and commenting. Adhering to these conventions helps ensure that the code is consistent and maintainable, and makes it easier for other developers to understand and work with the codebase.</description></item></channel></rss>
