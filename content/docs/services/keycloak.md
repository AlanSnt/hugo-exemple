## Context
### **Description**
    Keycloak is an open source identity and access management platform that provides authentication, authorization, and security features for applications and services. It allows users to authenticate with different protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML, and provides user, role, and group management features. Keycloak can be used as a standalone identity server or integrated into Java, Node.js, and other platforms.

### **Features**
*Keycloak provides a range of features, including:*

    - Authentication with support for different protocols, such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.
    - Authorization with support for fine-grained access control, role-based access control, and more.
    - User, role, and group management with support for custom attributes, federation, and more.
    - Single sign-on (SSO) with support for different clients and applications.
    - Security features such as two-factor authentication (2FA), password policies, and more.

## Key Concepts
### **Realms**
    A realm is a security domain in Keycloak that contains a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. Each realm has its own user database, configuration, and security policies. Realms can be used to separate different applications, organizations, or environments.

### **Providers**
    Keycloak uses providers to enable various features such as authentication, authorization, social login, and more. Providers are pluggable modules that can be configured and customized to meet your specific requirements. Examples of providers include identity brokering, authentication flows, and user federation.

### **Clients**
    A client is an entity in Keycloak that represents a protected application or service. Clients can be web applications, mobile applications, or service providers. Each client has its own set of configuration settings, such as redirect URIs, client IDs, and client secrets.

### **Groups**
    Groups are a way to organize users within a realm. Groups can be used to manage access control, assign roles and permissions, and more. Users can be members of multiple groups, and groups can have subgroups.

### **Roles**
    Roles define permissions within a realm or client. Roles can be assigned to users or groups to control access to specific resources or actions. Roles can be hierarchical, with parent roles and child roles.
